## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm blue (#64B5F6), evoking a sense of trust and nostalgia. Chosen for being friendly and reminiscent of school colors without being overly academic.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a desaturated variant of the primary color. It provides a soft and unobtrusive backdrop that allows the content to stand out.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#FFAB40), used for calls to action and interactive elements. This hue sits in the analogous range while being sufficiently distinct from the primary palette to attract attention.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for longer passages of text
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif with an elegant feel, suitable for headlines.
- Use clean, outlined icons related to school events and activities. Icons should be simple and easily recognizable.
- Subtle fade-in animations for content loading and transitions between pages to provide a smooth user experience.
